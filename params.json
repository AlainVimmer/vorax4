When applied to Oracle development or database administration it brings a lot of efficiency and fun.\r\n* **the need for a cross platform tool**. Vim is available on many platforms which means you're free to use it on any OS you like.\r\n* **availability as a console IDE**. Having a shiny IDE on a slow SSH connection doesn't sound so good, does it?\r\n* **having an IDE with a small footprint**. VoraX is nothing but a collection of VimL and Ruby scripts provided as a Vim plugin. We hope VoraX will consume as less resources as possible.\r\n* **the dream of an improved SqlPLUS environment**. I know a lot of guys (including me) who use SqlPLUS a lot, even for complex tasks. On the other hand, its limitations are quite annoying: we want good code completion, pretty print output and so on. We cannot get rid of SqlPLUS because we still think it's a great tool, but we can make it better. This is another goal of VoraX.\r\n\r\n# Features\r\n\r\n| Feature        | |\r\n| -------------- | --:|\r\n| Code completion | ![ok](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6430366/ok.png) |\r\n| Database explorer | ![ok](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6430366/ok.png) |\r\n| Connections manager | ![ok](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6430366/ok.png) |\r\n| Formatted output | ![ok](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6430366/ok.png) |\r\n| PLSQL compiling support | ![ok](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6430366/ok.png) |\r\n| Integrated Oracle documentation search | ![ok](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6430366/ok.png) |\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\nFor other details about this project don't hesitate to have a look at our [wiki](https://github.com/talek/vorax4-beta/wiki).\r\n\r\n# Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\nThis is an open source project.
